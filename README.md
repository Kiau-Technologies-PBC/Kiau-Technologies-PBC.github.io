Much has changed, added the 3D scans to the website. We are now trying to rework the page such that there is less clutter of nodes on the index.html page. Also will be adding more information on the pages that do not contain any information now. 
Removed nodes: 
- Urban Composting Tech (connected to Soil Remediation and Mottai-Nai)
- Soil Remediation (connected to Urban composting Tech, Soil Health Monitoring, Mycomaterials)
- Myco-Sensors (connected to Mycomaterials and Soil Health Monitoring)

Created node positioning attributes such that the nodes text is always opposite from the middle of the screen. 
Then added this to the y axis as well. Then smoothened the transition a little. 
Also added more iphone compatibility, making the graph generate more vertical for phones.

Added phone compatability via CSS. Created preset numbers and made nodes.js access these variables and update them according to maximum screen width.
